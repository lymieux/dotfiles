# dotfiles
> A curated list of awesome READMEs

This is a collection of my dotfiles in my home directory. 
I usually do not update documentation on certain scripts or lines, but I do update code.

I recently moved back to Windows for my home computer because of work/school related applications.
My hardware is not so Linux friendly, especially on a cutting-edge and sometimes unstable Arch distro.

That being said, this is for my WSL installation, which is Arch, but I'm currently learning Gentoo
